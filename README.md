# Twitter_bot 

Hello and welcome to my corner of Github, This project as you may have guessed is a twitter bot. For a full write up on how it works checkout my blog [breen.ie/twitter-bot/](www.breen.ie/twitter-bot/).

To get this bad boy up and running go ahead and clone the repo

` git clone git@github.com:conor-projects/Twitter_bot.git `

Next we need to install the Tweepy library:

`pip install tweepy  `

You can also clone the repository and install it manyally if you should so wish (I ended up using this method):

```
git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git  
cd tweepy  
python setup.py install
```
Now you need to create your twitter account, so introduce yourself to Big Sean Murphy, Political representive of Ireland

)

head over to twitter and get yourself an api key and add them into the `twitter_bot.py` file.

Now you're good to go

`python3 twitter_bot.py`

It should look a little something like this
